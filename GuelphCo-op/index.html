                <h1 id="ricoh">Ricoh Canada Inc.</h1>
                <p id="ricohContent">
                    Ricoh is a multi-national corporation that originated in Japan. They produce
                    printers, mutli-functional printers (MFP) and some cameras. The MFPs are Ricoh's
                    main product so a lot of their development goes towards making them better. MFPs
                    can scan, copy and print as their main functions, and recently there is a touch
                    device on the front to control the MFP. This touch device is an Android device
                    called a Smart Operation Panel (SOP). The SOP is the same for every MFP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ricoh Canada is a branch of Ricoh that operates in Canada. I worked at the
                    Kitchener, Ontario office as part of the software development division.
                </p>
                <h1 id="ricohJob">Job Description</h1>
                <p id="ricohJobContent">
                    My job was, for the vast majority of time, to develop apps that would run on
                    SOPs. This was Android development and since all of the panels are the same, it
                    was unified at API level 17.
                    <br>
                    Going into this job, I had less than a year of Java experience and zero Android
                    experience. I had to learn everything that I needed to know on my own time, so I
                    taught myself Android development.
                    <br>
                    For the first couple months I worked on free apps that customers could download
                    from the SOP app store. They all augmented the way that a user could interact
                    with the panels. For example, instead of doing a plain copy, one of our apps
                    would copy with a watermark.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The biggest application that I helped develop was called Common Authentication
                    Card version 4 (CAC4). The idea was that you could use a special kind of card
                    (CAC) to login to an MFP and scan documents to a secure shared-filesystem
                    or email the documents. The emailed documents could be encrypted and/or have
                    a signature to verify the authenticity of the documents.
                    <br>
                    There was a previous version of CAC that ran on the Java-only side of the MFP,
                    but now a customer wanted to update CAC to run it on this new kind of MFP with
                    an SOP. There were some parts of the old code that we could re-use but for the
                    most part it was a re-engineering effort.
                    <br>
                    This was a paid application so it had to have high quality code and go through
                    the proper phases of testing before it could be released.
                </p>
                <h1 id="ricohGoals">Goals</h1>
                <p id="ricohGoalsContent">
                    Since I didn't have any Android experience going into this Co-op term, one of my
                    biggest goals was to learn Android development. Since this was the main focus
                    of my work, I learned the basics of Android quickly but I was still learning new
                    things about Android near the very end of my 8 months.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I had only very little experience with networking, so one of my other goals was
                    to learn more about networking. I definitely got my foot in the water with a
                    servlet that CAC4 used to allow the user to perform various operations such as,
                    modifying settings or uploading a background that would be shown on the SOP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Application interface programming is definitely a tricky subject to get right
                    in Software Development. That is why I chose to get better at API programming
                    as one of my goals. While I didn't get any experience programming public
                    APIs, I did get experience and feedback while creating classes that would be
                    used by other people. These classes had to designed such that the average
                    developer would not have to actually look at the class to understand what it
                    did. For example, I created an Android library that made a REST call to obtain
                    information about the MFP's capabilities with regards to its many functions,
                    scanning, copying, printing and generic device info.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My last goal that I set for myself was not a programming related one. Since this
                    was my first real job experience working with other people to develop code, I had
                    to get better at my communication skills. I had the chance to improve these skills
                    everyday by having a stand-up with my team and interacting with other people.
                </p>
                <h1 id="ricohSummary">Summary</h1>
                <p id="ricohSummaryContent">
                    I learned a lot of software development practices in this Co-op term with Ricoh.
                    I also definitely improved my ability to develop software with the following
                    largest contributing factors:
                    <br>
                    &bull; Working with Android and Java nearly everyday
                    <br>
                    &bull; Using the Agile methodology in the development of CAC4
                    <br>
                    &bull; Using Checkstyle, Findbugs and other similar tools to improve my code
                    quality
                    <br>
                    &bull; Helping co-workers solve problems that they were stuck on and vice-versa
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All in all, my placement at Ricoh was very successful and I enjoyed working
                    there as my first real Software Development job.

                    Intrigue Media is a company that started in Guelph not too long ago, and it's only recently that they have become a big presence in the online marketing industry.
                    <br>
                    In particular, they do advertising for local businesses that have minimal or no online presence. Given the nature of the work, all of the work that gets done for clients is chunked and broken up between team members, based on their role in the company. To facilitate this work split, each team member is given tasks that need to be done, as action items, and their time is tracked for the amount of work needed to complete the task. This team is called the Operations Team.
                    <br>
                    There is also a sales team team that handles direct communication and negotiation with clients. This team also had action items for the client that they worked with.
                </p>
                <h1 id="intrigueJob">Job Description</h1>
                <p id="intrigueJobContent">
                    My time at Intrigue was essentially into two distinct parts. The first part was working on a classic PHP served website, and the second was to work on a game that ran on Node.js.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first part was not to work directly with clients, or client work, but to make the lives of Operations Team easier. By the time I came along, Intrigue Media had only had a software development team for about a year. At the start of my time, there was a website that existed for the Operations Team to use to keep track of their action items. I enhanced this website, adding functionality that got hooked up to an external API server. These enhancements were mainly to replace old functionality that had lived in a Google Sheet. Some of these were to include a login for each team member, track how much work each team member can perform each month, or do an analysis on action items for either team members or clients and get useful metrics. The website was served with a PHP server and HTML, CSS and JS to give the team members a good view.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second part was to work on a Trivia Game to get the community engaged. Like the first website, the Game was already in the middle of development. The Game is run on a Node.js server and each user can connect to the game to access the same question. First, I focused on improving the gameplay for the users. One improvement was that the Game needed to be synced across everyone currently playing it and WebSockets were used to obtain that requirement. This second part was very different because the most of my work had to be done on the server-side rather on the client-side, which took a different mindset to solve the problems.
                </p>
                <h1 id="intrigueGoals">Goals</h1>
                <p id="intrigueGoalsContent">
                    Going into this co-op, I had two major programming goals: get experience with web front-end and web back-end. I also made a goal to get better at explaining technical issues to non-technical people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These goals matched up nicely with my co-op term. As the first part was mostly doing website development for the Intrigue team, I got a lot of experience developing web front-end. Starting this co-op term, I had very little experience with anything web related. Now, I have essential experience for web front-end development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With working on the Trivia Game for my second part at Intrigue, I was able to work towards my goal of getting more experience with servers. Node.js seems like it was a good first step in learning web back-ends, as it gave me knowledge of the general server workflow. However, it is also different from traditional server technologies like PHP because of Node's asynchronous nature.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I worked at Intrigue, the development team was very small in comparison to the rest of the company. Not everyone there was technologically savvy, so it gave me a good chance to explain technical issues.
                </p>
                <h1 id="intrigueSummary">Summary</h1>
                <p id="intrigueSummaryContent">
                    Although I'd been through three years of school and an 8 month co-op work term, I still hadn't had very much experience with web technologies. That's why I wanted a co-op job where I could get experience with web technologies. Intrigue Media aligned very well with what I wanted to do.
                    <br>
                    During my co-op with Intrigue, I worked on:
                    <br>
                    &bull; A website to help everyone at Intrigue do their work more efficiently
                    <br>
                    &bull; A Trivia Game to engage the community
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These were great projects to work on that gave me experience with the entire full-stack workflow. I'm very certain that I learned applicable skills that I can use for anything web related.

                <p id="jibestreamContent">
                    Jibestream is an indoor mapping company in Toronto, Ontario. They specialize in delivering customized mapping experiences to their customers. This includes not only creating the maps from a floorplan, but also giving their customers the ability to put those maps inside of apps via their own software development kit.
                </p>
                <h1 id="jibestreamJob">Job Description</h1>
                <p id="jibestreamJobContent">
                    My job at Jibestream was to improve an existing mapping application. This old one was created with an older version of the SDK, and hosted on-site. I worked with another co-op student to reverse engineer this application.
                    <br>
                    We had to develop it in such a way that it had the same aesthetic and functionality, so that if it were to replace the existing solution, it wouldn't have any noticeable differences. This meant that we had to look carefully at all of the details that defined the older product, and replicate them to the best of our ability.
                    <br>
                    Our first shot for it was completely written from scratch. This was also our first time writing a big project in React, and we didn't have any kind of special state management like Redux. This worked out pretty well, but it did make that application fairly unmaintainable.
                    <br>
                    Our second try was to develop the application from a project layout that already existed. There were a lot of parts that we were able to reuse as there was a basic framework for Redux-React already in place, so we ported our old code over. There were a bunch of parts that were impossible to port in their original form, so we have to split those parts up.
                </p>
                <h1 id="jibestreamGoals">Goals</h1>
                <p id="jibestreamGoalsContent">
                    For this co-op there were some technologies that I hadn't had any experience with before, so I wanted to become proficient with them. They were:
                    <br>
                    &#x2022;Learn Redux, React and Sass
                    <br>
                    &#x2022;Understand how mapping software works, specifically how Jibestream stores and uses its maps
                    <br>
                    &#x2022;Be able to give good, succinct feedback on code reviews
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For all of these goals, I was able to accomplish them, or at least gain experience in their field. I was able to work with Redux, React and Sass through the project specified in the last section. To create that application, I also used Jibestream's own SDK, so I got a basic understanding of how mapping software works. During the development with my co-op partner, we both did code reviews for each other.

                <p id="jibestreamSummaryContent">
                    Overall, Jibestream was a good company to work at, although my stay did get cut unexpectedly short. My biggest takeaway from my time there was the development in React because that can be applied to any kind of web development, as long as they are using React as the framework of choice. I did learn the fundamentals of indoor mapping, which may come in handy later.

This system would be employed by any company that needs to control those printer devices, either in a single location or spread across several facilities.

                    The first project that I worked on as a part of my job, was to create an automated testing system for SLNX. The idea behind this was that there wasn't any kind of testing to easily check for regressions with each update to SLNX. With this final goal in mind, I first needed to understand this complex system. After I had a basic grasp of SLNX, I started to build the framework for the testing system, in Java. The biggest difficulty with this project was trying to figure out all of the components that would be required. To combat this, I was given a couple basic tests to start writing. SLNX has to keep track of users, so my first test was to use the established REST interface to add a new user. My second test was to use the basic print submission flow to submit a print job, checking for any possible failures along the way.

                    During my time at Ricoh this summer, I also worked on a second project. Somewhat similar to the testing automation, this project was a health check for one of the servers that is a part of SLNX. The main responsibility of this server is to be a local contact point for printers in a single location, which is why it is called the Delegation Server. There is also another server called the Core Server, which is the main store of information. There is only ever a single Core Server in a deployment, but there may or may not be more than one Delegation Server. The purpose of my Health Check was to make sure that the main workflow for print job submission is functioning, which would give you a better clue of that actual state of a Delegation Server than, say, a ping service. This health check was a command line program, also written in Java so that it could take advantage of the previously written libraries for SLNX.

                <p id="ricoh2GoalsContent">
                    Since I only had slightly fewer than 6 months for this Co-op, I knew that I wouldn't be able to "finish" the test automation project, as it is a massive undertaking. A big part would be to leave a manageable project behind for anybody else who would need to work on it. And to make any kind of project manageable, you need to take good notes and keep it organized, which ties into a couple of my goals.

                    <br>
                    The testing automation project absolutely helped my design and implementation skills as I had to be conscious of my decisions because they would be left to, at least, the next developer that works on this project. However, good design usually can't be attained without any implementation whatsoever, so it really helped that I had a good feedback loop when I was implementing those test cases.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to generally commenting the code that I wrote, writing any additional documentation was critical. Since the automation testing may require other components to be set up, such as a virtual machine, this setup must be documented in a way that is easy for someone else to follow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Actually implementing automation testing really helped me get a good grasp on the concept. There are a lot of things that need to thought about such as how the testing is set up and torn down. A good automation test, ideally, shouldn't leave any trace that it was run, and it shouldn't require any human intervention for it to run, so it needs to make sure the testing environment is estabished by itself.

                    My last co-op was very valuable to me. I hadn't had any experience with automated testing before, but this work term really made me dive head first into it. I can imagine automated testing being very valuable to many different companies in my future.
                    <br>
                    Improving my communication skills will always continue to help me, pretty much no matter what kind of career path I choose to pursue.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although I may not be able to reuse the code that I wrote in Java, the concepts that I gained while working for Ricoh will stick with me forever.

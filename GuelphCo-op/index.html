                    My name is Benjamin Cecile and I am a student at the University of Guelph. I
                    started my Software Engineering degree in Fall 2014. My degree is part of a
                    Co-op program that allows me to work some semesters and go to school those other
                    semesters.
                    <br>
                    This website will show you the co-op experience that I have gained during my
                    academic career.

                <h1 id="ricoh">Ricoh Canada Inc.</h1>
                <p id="ricohContent">
                    Ricoh is a multi-national corporation that originated in Japan. They produce
                    printers, mutli-functional printers (MFP) and some cameras. The MFPs are Ricoh's
                    main product so a lot of their development goes towards making them better. MFPs
                    can scan, copy and print as their main functions, and recently there is a touch
                    device on the front to control the MFP. This touch device is an Android device
                    called a Smart Operation Panel (SOP). The SOP is the same for every MFP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ricoh Canada is a branch of Ricoh that operates in Canada. I worked at the
                    Kitchener, Ontario office as part of the software development division.
                </p>
                <h1 id="ricohJob">Job Description</h1>
                <p id="ricohJobContent">
                    My job was, for the vast majority of time, to develop apps that would run on
                    SOPs. This was Android development and since all of the panels are the same, it
                    was unified at API level 17.
                    <br>
                    Going into this job, I had less than a year of Java experience and zero Android
                    experience. I had to learn everything that I needed to know on my own time, so I
                    taught myself Android development.
                    <br>
                    For the first couple months I worked on free apps that customers could download
                    from the SOP app store. They all augmented the way that a user could interact
                    with the panels. For example, instead of doing a plain copy, one of our apps
                    would copy with a watermark.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The biggest application that I helped develop was called Common Authentication
                    Card version 4 (CAC4). The idea was that you could use a special kind of card
                    (CAC) to login to an MFP and scan documents to a secure shared-filesystem
                    or email the documents. The emailed documents could be encrypted and/or have
                    a signature to verify the authenticity of the documents.
                    <br>
                    There was a previous version of CAC that ran on the Java-only side of the MFP,
                    but now a customer wanted to update CAC to run it on this new kind of MFP with
                    an SOP. There were some parts of the old code that we could re-use but for the
                    most part it was a re-engineering effort.
                    <br>
                    This was a paid application so it had to have high quality code and go through
                    the proper phases of testing before it could be released.
                </p>
                <h1 id="ricohGoals">Goals</h1>
                <p id="ricohGoalsContent">
                    Since I didn't have any Android experience going into this Co-op term, one of my
                    biggest goals was to learn Android development. Since this was the main focus
                    of my work, I learned the basics of Android quickly but I was still learning new
                    things about Android near the very end of my 8 months.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I had only very little experience with networking, so one of my other goals was
                    to learn more about networking. I definitely got my foot in the water with a
                    servlet that CAC4 used to allow the user to perform various operations such as,
                    modifying settings or uploading a background that would be shown on the SOP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Application interface programming is definitely a tricky subject to get right
                    in Software Development. That is why I chose to get better at API programming
                    as one of my goals. While I didn't get any experience programming public
                    APIs, I did get experience and feedback while creating classes that would be
                    used by other people. These classes had to designed such that the average
                    developer would not have to actually look at the class to understand what it
                    did. For example, I created an Android library that made a REST call to obtain
                    information about the MFP's capabilities with regards to its many functions,
                    scanning, copying, printing and generic device info.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My last goal that I set for myself was not a programming related one. Since this
                    was my first real job experience working with other people to develop code, I had
                    to get better at my communication skills. I had the chance to improve these skills
                    everyday by having a stand-up with my team and interacting with other people.
                </p>
                <h1 id="ricohSummary">Summary</h1>
                <p id="ricohSummaryContent">
                    I learned a lot of software development practices in this Co-op term with Ricoh.
                    I also definitely improved my ability to develop software with the following
                    largest contributing factors:
                    <br>
                    &bull; Working with Android and Java nearly everyday
                    <br>
                    &bull; Using the Agile methodology in the development of CAC4
                    <br>
                    &bull; Using Checkstyle, Findbugs and other similar tools to improve my code
                    quality
                    <br>
                    &bull; Helping co-workers solve problems that they were stuck on and vice-versa
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All in all, my placement at Ricoh was very successful and I enjoyed working
                    there as my first real Software Development job.

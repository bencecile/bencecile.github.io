# bencecile.github.io
The repository is dedicated to any web projects that I need to be easily hosted.

There are currently two different projects here.
- [3DStar](https://bencecile.github.io/3DStar) is a fun little project to create these stars that look 3D. The functionality is very limited right now, as it was more of a proof of concept for myself.
- [Guelph Co-op](http://bencecile.github.io/GuelphCo-op) is a small site that showcases what I have done during my work terms.
